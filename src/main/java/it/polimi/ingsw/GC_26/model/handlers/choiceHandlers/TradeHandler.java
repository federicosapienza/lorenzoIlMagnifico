 * This class represents the handler for the trades. Trades need dialogue with user: they're usually based on choices and player 
 * can also decide not to trade!
 * Creation rules: 
 * If a resource to be given can be traded in two different ways, this resource is inserted both in give1 and give2
 * If there is a choice in giving and only one possible outcome, the outcome is inserted both in receive1 and receive2. 
 * If there is only one income and only one outcome give2 and receive2 are set as null; 
 * So there's one between give2 and receive2 that is not null, the other one (receive2 or give2) is not null too.
 * 
 * Choice rules: 0 means refuse trade, 2 means second choice if present, any other value for first choice. 
 * If second choice is not present 2 stands for accepting first choice
 * When trade is done, if the action has not ended yet, production is restarted from where it was interrupted
