 * This class represents the trade effect, which has 2 sub-categories
 * 1) as permanent effect: it needs to ask the player what he wants to do, because there is the possibility to choose 
 * and he can also decide not to trade.
 * 2) as immediate effect: automatically done if it's possible (works with receive1 - give1; not present in the 
 * original game but it is implemented anyway)
 * 
 * Creation rules:
 * - If a resource that has to be given can be traded in two different ways, this resource must be inserted both in give1 and give2.
 * - If there is a choice in giving and only one possible outcome, the outcome must be inserted both in receive1 that receive2. 
 * - If there is only one income and only one outcome give2 and receive2 have to be null; 
 * 
 * So if either give2 or receive2 is not null, the other one (receive2 or give2) cannot be null
 *
